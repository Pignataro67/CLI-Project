# DailyWorkout

Daily Workout is a selection of different exercises for the major muscle groups, Legs, Back, Chest, Shoulders and core! If you're looking for a "sun's out, guns out" routine you're in the wrong place! This is more of a "sun's out, buns out" workout!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'daily_workout'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install daily_workout

## Usage

This is meant to be used by selecting a workout by number and enjoying. Any other usage is strictly not advised. Practice safe sets!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
